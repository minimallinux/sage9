##P A McGowan

Sage 9, sample custom templates and images etc, for pages, hard code templates and select in WP-Admin (leave page blank) or create new ones, decent size footer with 5 columns for image/links etc using widgets. Switch different header in app.blade, one for front page and one for the rest.

Woocommerce 3.3 and Advanced Custom Fields added already, remove any not required by deleting them from resources and /app/setup.php (bottom of file)

Lots of extra widgets added for footer etc for links, ads or whatever. Uses Font Awesome 4.7 via CDN link in head.blade.

Add any CSS Framework or files to customise. Good Starter point with some setup already done.
